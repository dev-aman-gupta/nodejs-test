1) Explain the difference between an abstract class and an interface.
Answer: 
An abstract class is used when there are multiple classes which require/share a common logic, then we can create an abstract class and allow those concrete classes to extend it.
Interfaces are implemented by a class, all methods of an interface need to be implemented by a class. 

Variables inside an interface are constant while variables of an abstract class can be  modified by a method.
These are used for abstraction where we don't want the shared logic to be known by classes. 
 
2) What is the purpose of getters and setters in a class?
Answer: Getters and setters are used to get or set the values of the class variables. These are used to prevent any unauthorized method/class access the values or a method/class updates the invalid value.
Setter methods can be used to do the type check, or any custom checks required before the value is assigned to the variable.
Getter methods can be used to set access of the values based on roles or authentication etc.
